Hi! I'm currently working on obtaining the Salesforce Platform Developer I certification in August of 2024. I'm currently enrolled in Cloud Code Academy Developer Kickstart Cohort 5.
I'm super excited. 

I have a dog, Yeezy.

I hope I remember to update this when I pass the exam. Someone remind me, please. lol ðŸ˜„
